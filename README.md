# WIGO
Modular open source construction system

WIGO is a concept for a modular system that allows to exchange panels of the facade to relocate the doors and windows. 
This way you can renovate, extend or change the indoor layout of a project without waste generation. 
The main idea is to have components that can be moved to another possition, changed and even sold to a second hand market if it is needed.

The system is still at a conceptual level. But it can be thought as parts built with CNC machines using Cross Laminated Timber (CLT) panels.

This is only an idea. A lot of development is needed. The repository has the FreeCAD files of basic parts for the main frame (picture). You can fork it, improve it and add more parts if you want.

The components are files with FreeCAD format. I recommend to use non-parametric copies to assemble them.
