# WIGO
Modular open source construction system

WIGO is a concept for a modular system that allows to exchange panels of the facade to relocate the doors and windows. 
This way you can renovate, extend or change the indoor layout of a project without waste generation. 
The main idea is to have components that can be moved to another possition, changed and even sold to a second hand market if it is needed.

The system is still at a conceptual level. But it can be thought as parts built with CNC machines using Cross Laminated Timber (CLT) panels.
